# After you have written the reusable functions, answer the following:
# Questions:
# 1. What are the preconditions for your code not to break? 
#The get_weather function requires a valid OpenWeatherMap API key
# 2. Validate the user's input based on your preconditions.
#Ensure the name is not empty.
# 3. Why was it useful to use reusable components in this case? Please mention at least 2 reasons and don't forget to contextualise. It makes it so you don't have to type multiple times and you can save time.

# Further Tasks:
# 1. Put your functions in seperate appropriate files and import them in.
# 2. Make sure all of your functions (except the main one) only do ONE thing or process.
# 3. Add your own twist to the code.

# Extension:
# Add the following apis as reusable components and use them in your code:
