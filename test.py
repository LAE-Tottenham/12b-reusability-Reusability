# Help! I'm trying to make this cool bot but my code is too messy :( Please help me organise it into reusable components.

# Define your reusable functions here:


def genderGuesser():
    name = input("May I take your first name please? ")
    gender_result = guess_gender(name)
    gender = gender_result[0]
    prob_percent = gender_result[1]
    print(f"\nHmmm, I'm {prob_percent}% sure you are a {gender}.")

def pause(seconds):
    for i in range (seconds):
        time.sleep(1)
        print("...")

# Make sure each function only does ONE thing!!!!!!!!!!!

def guess_gender(name):
    gender_resp = requests.get(f"https://api.genderize.io/?name={name}").json()
    gender = gender_resp["gender"]
    prob_percent = gender_resp["probability"] * 100
    return [gender, prob_percent]

# After you have written the reusable functions, answer the following:
# Questions:
# 1. What are the preconditions for your code not to break?
# 2. Validate the user's input based on your preconditions.
# 3. Why was it useful to use reusable components in this case? Please mention at least 2 reasons and don't forget to contextualise.

# Further Tasks:
# 1. Put your functions in seperate appropriate files and import them in.
# 2. Make sure all of your functions (except the main one) only do ONE thing or process.
# 3. Add your own twist to the code.

# Extension:
# Add the following apis as reusable components and use them in your code:
